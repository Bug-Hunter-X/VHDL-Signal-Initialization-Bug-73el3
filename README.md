This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VHDL code related to signal initialization.  The `buggy_code.vhd` file contains the erroneous code, which initializes a signal with an incompatible value.  The `corrected_code.vhd` provides the corrected version with proper initialization, addressing the potential for unexpected behavior.
